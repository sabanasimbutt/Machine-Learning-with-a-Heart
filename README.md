# Machine-Learning-with-a-Heart

**Drivendata.org Warm Up Challenge**

This dataset is from a study of heart disease that has been open to the public for many years. The study collects various measurements on patient health and cardiovascular statistics, and of course makes patient identities anonymous.
Goal is to predict the binary class `heart_disease_present`, which represents whether or not a patient has heart disease.
